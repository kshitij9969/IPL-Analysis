Motivation: 

Indian Premeir League is the largest cricket tournament in the world hosted by the Board of Cricket Control in India(BCCI).
It is no surprise that the largest tournament hosts one of the largest auctions in the world(atleast as far as cricket tournaments
are concerened).

Some fun facts about IPL Auction
1. Each franchise spends close to 12$ million on buying players
2. Although number of franchises change each year, roughly 8-10 franchises bid during the auction.(transaction of 120$ million)
3. Cost of broadcasting rights: 16.3 Billion INR
4. Cost of title sponsorship: 2.1 Billion INR

Needless to say that a major aspect of IPL is monetary and hence mandates business acumen to make the 
most profits out of the 2 months long tournament.

Irrespective of the money poured, it is the teams or players that keep the tournament alive, garner more viwership,
attract more sponsors and are the raw material in the factory of IPL.

Last year in 2019, people witnessed some major hiccups in team selection of a few franchises. This unfortunately led to a very 
one-sided tournament. Viewer avoided the matches whose results they had already predicted. Such predictable tournaments not only
impact the business severly but also hits the morale of debutting players.

To address this it was necessary to do a thorough analysis of all players.
