Motivation: 

Indian Premier League is the largest cricket tournament in the world hosted by the Board of Cricket Control in India(BCCI).
It is no surprise that the largest tournament hosts one of the largest auctions in the world(as far as cricket tournaments
are concerned).

Some fun facts about IPL Auction
1. Each franchise spends close to 12$ million on buying players
2. Although the number of franchises changes each year, roughly 8-10 franchises bid during the auction. (transaction of 120$ million)
3. Cost of broadcasting rights: 16.3 Billion INR
4. Cost of title sponsorship: 2.1 Billion INR

Needless to say that a major aspect of IPL is monetary and hence mandates business acumen to make the 
most profits out of the 2 months long tournament.

Irrespective of the money poured, it is the teams or players that keep the tournament alive, garner more viewership,
attract more sponsors and are the raw material in the factory of IPL.

Last year in 2019, people witnessed some major hiccups in team selection of a few franchises. This, unfortunately, led to a very one-sided tournament. Viewer avoided the matches whose results they had already predicted. Such predictable tournaments not only
impact the business severely but also hits the morale of debuting players.

To address this it was necessary to do a thorough analysis of all players. 

Dataset: (Source: Kaggle)
1. Delivery - Contains data of every ball bowled in IPL 2008-2017
2. Matches - Contains metadata of every match played in IPL 2008-2017

You can download the dataset from either this repository or https://www.kaggle.com/manasgarg/ipl

IPL_Analysis.py - Python code for analysing the player stats

I have also created a tableau dashboard. https://public.tableau.com/profile/kshitij6814#!/vizhome/IPL_Analysis_15776535832250/Batting

Any suggestion for improvement in the code is welcomed.
